## Purpose of This Directory

These documents represent:

- **Working notes** from development sessions
- **Planning materials** that guided implementation decisions  
- **Analysis documents** that explored different approaches
- **Implementation checklists** used during development
- **Migration plans** for system upgrades

While these documents may not be directly useful for end users or ongoing development, they provide valuable historical context about why certain decisions were made and how the system evolved.

## Document Lifecycle

Documents in this directory typically:

1. Start as working documents during active development
2. Guide implementation and decision-making
3. Are superseded by formal documentation or implementation
4. Are moved here for historical reference

If information from these documents becomes permanently valuable, it should be:

- Extracted into formal [Developer Documentation](../developer/)
- Recorded as [Architectural Decision Records](../adr/)
- Included in [User Documentation](../user/) if relevant

## Related Resources

- [Architectural Decision Records](../adr/) - Formal architectural decisions
- [User Documentation](../user/) - End-user guides and tutorials
