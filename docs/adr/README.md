# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architectural Decision Records that document significant architectural decisions made during the development of BaseMcpServer.

## Available ADRs

### [Design Decisions](design_decisions.md)
Historical record of important design and architectural decisions made during development, including rationale and context for each decision.

## About ADRs

Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) are short text documents that capture an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. They help:

- Document the reasoning behind architectural choices
- Provide context for future developers
- Track the evolution of the system architecture
- Enable informed decision-making about changes

## Format

ADRs typically follow a standard format:

1. **Title**: Brief description of the decision
2. **Context**: The circumstances that led to the decision
3. **Decision**: What was decided
4. **Status**: Current status (proposed, accepted, deprecated, superseded)
5. **Consequences**: What becomes easier or more difficult
