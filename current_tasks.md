# Current Development Tasks

## Jira Helper Restructuring (High Priority)

### Phase 1: Business Logic Extraction
- [ ] Create `src/business/jira_operations.py` with pure functions
- [ ] Extract all functions from current MCP decorators in `mcp_adapter.py`
- [ ] Test business logic independently

### Phase 2: Server Factory Implementation
- [ ] Create `src/mcp/server_factory.py` with bulk tool registration
- [ ] Create `src/business/tool_definitions.py` with AI-optimized metadata
- [ ] Implement `create_tools_with_metadata()` function
- [ ] Test with all transports (stdio, sse)

### Phase 3: Single Entry Point
- [ ] Create new universal `main.py` with runtime transport selection
- [ ] Test transport selection (stdio, sse, avoid streamable-http)
- [ ] Verify Cline compatibility with SSE transport

### Phase 4: Cleanup and Documentation
- [ ] Remove old files: `streamable_main.py`, `http_main.py`, `http_adapter.py`
- [ ] Remove Docker files: `docker-compose.http.yml`, `Dockerfile.http`
- [ ] Update Docker configuration for SSE transport
- [ ] Update documentation

## Hexagonal Architecture DRY Cleanup (Medium Priority)

### Phase 3: Infrastructure Layer Cleanup (In Progress)
- [x] Create `infrastructure/base_adapter.py` with BaseJiraAdapter ✅
- [x] Migrate JiraApiRepository to use base adapter (69.6% reduction achieved) ✅
- [ ] Migrate remaining infrastructure adapters (TimeTracking, IssueLink, Search)
- [ ] Complete infrastructure layer cleanup

### Phase 4: Application Layer Cleanup
- [ ] Create `application/base_use_case.py` with BaseUseCase
- [ ] Migrate all use cases to use standardized result handling
- [ ] Test all use cases work correctly
- [ ] Verify 75% code reduction achieved

### Phase 5: Integration and Testing
- [ ] Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect simplified patterns
- [ ] Performance testing to verify improvements

## YAML Migration Completion (Low Priority)

### Remaining Tasks
- [ ] Redeploy jira-helper server with new configuration
- [ ] Test MCP server functionality end-to-end
- [ ] Update documentation and examples
- [ ] Remove old .env files and python-decouple references
- [ ] Update README with YAML configuration instructions
- [ ] Create config.yaml.example template

## MCP Best Practices Implementation

### Tool Metadata Optimization
- [ ] Implement hybrid strategy for tool descriptions
- [ ] Create tool definitions with AI-optimized descriptions
- [ ] Use explicit descriptions instead of relying on docstrings
- [ ] Ensure consistent metadata format across all tools

### Cline Compatibility
- [ ] Use SSE transport for remote servers (avoid streamable-http)
- [ ] Implement robust error handling for connection issues
- [ ] Test with multiple Cline versions
- [ ] Monitor GitHub issue #4391 for updates

## Documentation Consolidation ✅ COMPLETED

### Final Documentation Structure
- `current_tasks.md` - Consolidated task list with extracted information ✅
- `design_decisions.md` - Project decision history (preserved) ✅
- `jira_info.md` - Current project tracking (preserved) ✅
- `readme.md` - Main project README (preserved) ✅
- `docs/cline-compatibility.md` - Current compatibility info (preserved) ✅
- Server-specific READMEs in individual directories (preserved) ✅

### Successfully Extracted and Deleted ✅
- All redundant planning documents, analyses, and guides have been consolidated
- Key information extracted into current_tasks.md
- 18 redundant markdown files removed
- Clean, focused documentation structure achieved

### Key Information Extracted
- **Jira Helper Restructuring Plan**: Phases 1-4 extracted to current tasks
- **Hexagonal DRY Cleanup**: Remaining phases 3-5 extracted
- **MCP Best Practices**: Tool metadata and compatibility guidelines extracted
- **YAML Migration**: Remaining deployment tasks extracted
- **Technical Insights**: Bulk registration patterns, transport recommendations

## Success Metrics

### Code Reduction Targets
