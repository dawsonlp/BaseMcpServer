## Current Work: Jira Helper Enhancements

**Epic:** MET-6 - Development Tools Enhancement  
**Previous Task:** MET-7 - Migrate Jira Helper MCP Server to YAML Configuration âœ… COMPLETED  
**Current Task:** MET-8 - Enhance Jira Helper with Issue Linking, Updates, and JQL Search

### Previous Work (MET-7) - COMPLETED
Restore and complete the YAML configuration migration for the jira-helper MCP server that was lost during a merge conflict. This included:

- Restore YAML config.py from commit d87ebe1
- Add missing get_jira_instance() method for hexagonal architecture compatibility
- Remove .env files to ensure clean YAML-only configuration
- Complete hexagonal architecture implementation
- Add comprehensive testing framework
- Successfully test with personal Jira instance connection

### Current Work (MET-8) - IN PROGRESS
Enhance the jira-helper MCP server with additional functionality:

**New Features:**
1. **Issue Update Functionality** - Update existing issues (summary, description, priority, assignee, labels)
2. **Direct JQL Search** - Execute JQL queries with pagination and validation
3. **Issue Linking System** - Generic issue linking with Epic-Story and Parent-Child relationships

**Architecture:**
- Follow hexagonal architecture principles
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Add comprehensive domain models, services, and ports
- Implement proper validation and error handling

**Implementation Phases:**
- Phase 1: Domain Layer (models, ports, services, exceptions) âœ… COMPLETED
- Phase 2: Application Layer (use cases) - NEXT
- Phase 3: Infrastructure Layer (Jira client enhancements)
- Phase 4: Adapter Layer (new MCP tools)
- Phase 5: Testing and Documentation

### Status
ðŸš§ **IN PROGRESS** - Phase 1 (Domain Layer) completed, moving to Phase 2 (Application Layer)
