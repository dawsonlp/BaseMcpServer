**Epic:** MET-6 - Development Tools Enhancement  
**Previous Task:** MET-8 - Enhance Jira Helper with Issue Linking, Updates, and JQL Search âœ… COMPLETED  
**Current Task:** MET-10 - Enhanced Logging with File Output, Rotation, and Retention Policies

### Previous Work (MET-7) - COMPLETED
Restore and complete the YAML configuration migration for the jira-helper MCP server that was lost during a merge conflict. This included:

- Restore YAML config.py from commit d87ebe1
- Add missing get_jira_instance() method for hexagonal architecture compatibility
- Remove .env files to ensure clean YAML-only configuration
- Complete hexagonal architecture implementation
- Add comprehensive testing framework
- Successfully test with personal Jira instance connection

### Previous Work (MET-8) - COMPLETED
Enhance the jira-helper MCP server with additional functionality:

**New Features:**
1. **Issue Update Functionality** - Update existing issues (summary, description, priority, assignee, labels)
2. **Direct JQL Search** - Execute JQL queries with pagination and validation
3. **Issue Linking System** - Generic issue linking with Epic-Story and Parent-Child relationships
4. **Time Tracking** - Work logging, time estimates, and time tracking info
5. **Workflow Visualization** - Multi-format workflow graphs (JSON, PNG, SVG, DOT, ASCII)

**Architecture:**
- Complete hexagonal architecture implementation
- 25+ new MCP tools with comprehensive functionality
- Multi-instance support across different Jira environments
- Extensive domain models, services, and comprehensive error handling

### Current Work (MET-10) - IN PROGRESS
Implement comprehensive logging enhancements for the Jira Helper MCP Server:

**Requirements:**
1. **File-Based Logging** - YAML configuration for log file root directory, structured file logging
2. **Log Rotation** - Automatic rotation based on file size/time, configurable policies, compressed archives
3. **Data Retention** - Configurable retention periods, automatic cleanup, separate policies by log level
4. **Configuration** - YAML-based logging config, environment-specific settings, runtime adjustment
5. **Monitoring** - Log health checks, disk space management, error alerting

**Implementation Phases:**
- Phase 1: YAML Configuration Enhancement - NEXT
- Phase 2: File Logging Implementation
- Phase 3: Log Rotation System
- Phase 4: Data Retention Policies
- Phase 5: Testing and Documentation

### Status
ðŸš§ **IN PROGRESS** - Starting Phase 1 (YAML Configuration Enhancement)
