# MCP Manager Removal - Test Execution Guide

## Overview

This guide walks you through running the functional test for MCP Manager's removal commands. The test validates complete removal workflow using a temporary test server.

## What This Test Does

The test script (`test_removal_functionality.py`) performs an automated, end-to-end test of the removal functionality:

1. **Phase 1: Setup** - Installs test server and configures for both platforms
2. **Phase 2: Remove from Claude** - Tests platform-specific removal (Claude Desktop)
3. **Phase 3: Remove from Cline** - Tests platform-specific removal (Cline)
4. **Phase 4: Remove from Registry** - Tests registry removal with file cleanup
5. **Phase 5: Complete Removal** - Tests single-command complete removal

At each phase, the script:
- âœ… Runs removal commands automatically
- âœ… Verifies config files are updated correctly
- âœ… Checks that files are cleaned up properly
- âœ… Prompts you to verify functionality in applications

## Prerequisites

### Required:
- âœ… mcp-manager installed and working
- âœ… Python 3.10+ available
- âœ… Terminal access

### Recommended:
- âœ… Claude Desktop installed (for complete testing)
- âœ… VS Code with Cline extension installed (for complete testing)

**Note:** The test can still run without Claude Desktop or Cline installed - it will skip the manual verification steps for those platforms.

## Before You Start

### 1. Backup Safety
The test will automatically create backups, but it's good practice to ensure:
- You have no unsaved work in Claude Desktop
- You have no unsaved work in VS Code/Cline
- You're comfortable with the test modifying your MCP configurations

### 2. Time Estimate
- **Full test:** 15-20 minutes
- **Automated checks only:** 5 minutes (if you skip manual platform verification)

### 3. What Gets Modified
The test will temporarily:
- Add/remove "test-echo-server" from mcp-manager registry
- Add/remove "test-echo-server" from Claude Desktop config
- Add/remove "test-echo-server" from Cline config
- Create/remove files in `~/.config/mcp-manager/servers/test-echo-server/`

**All changes are reverted by end of test!**

## Running the Test

### Step 1: Navigate to the test directory
```bash
cd /path/to/BaseMcpServer/utils/mcp_manager
```

### Step 2: Run the test script
```bash
python3 test_removal_functionality.py
```

or

```bash
./test_removal_functionality.py
```

### Step 3: Follow the prompts

The test is interactive and will:
1. Show colored output indicating progress
2. Pause at verification points
3. Ask you to manually check functionality in applications
4. Continue automatically after you confirm

## What You'll Need to Do

### During Phase 1 (Setup):
After installation, you'll be asked to:
1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Look for `test_echo` tool in the tools list
3. Test the tool - it should return: "ðŸ§ª TEST-ECHO-SERVER IS WORKING! ðŸŽ‰"
4. Open VS Code with Cline
5. Look for `test_echo` tool
6. Test it in Cline

Type `yes` when both work correctly.

### During Phase 2 (Remove from Claude):
After removal, you'll be asked to:
1. Restart Claude Desktop
2. Verify `test_echo` tool is NO LONGER available
3. Check Cline still has the tool

Type `yes` to confirm.

### During Phase 3 (Remove from Cline):
After removal, you'll be asked to:
1. Restart VS Code / Reload Cline
2. Verify `test_echo` tool is NO LONGER available in Cline
3. Confirm Claude Desktop also doesn't have it

Type `yes` to confirm.

### During Phases 4 & 5:
These are fully automated - just watch the progress!

## Interpreting Results

### Success Output
```
================================================================================
                              TEST COMPLETE âœ“                                  
================================================================================

All tests passed!

Summary:
  âœ“ Server can be removed from individual platforms
  âœ“ Server can be removed from registry with file cleanup
  âœ“ Server can be completely removed in one command
  âœ“ Configs are updated correctly
  âœ“ Files are cleaned up properly
  âœ“ Backups are created automatically

The removal functionality is working correctly!
```

### If Test Fails
The script will show:
- âœ— Clear error messages indicating what failed
- Which phase failed
- What to check manually

Common issues:
- **"Server not found in registry"** - mcp-manager may not be properly installed
- **"Tool not working"** - May need to restart applications
- **"Config file not found"** - Platform may not be installed or configured

## What Gets Left Behind

### After Successful Test:
- âœ… All test server entries removed
- âœ… All test server files cleaned up
- âœ… Your original configs restored (via automatic backups)
- âœ… Backup files in `~/.config/mcp-manager/backups/` (these are safe to delete)

### To Clean Up Backups (optional):
```bash
rm -rf ~/.config/mcp-manager/backups/
```

## Troubleshooting

### Test Won't Start
**Problem:** Script won't run  
**Solution:** Ensure it's executable: `chmod +x test_removal_functionality.py`

### mcp-manager Commands Fail
**Problem:** "mcp-manager: command not found"  
**Solution:** Ensure mcp-manager is installed and in your PATH

### Server Won't Install
**Problem:** Installation fails  
**Solution:** Check that the test-echo-server directory exists and has all files

### Tools Don't Appear in Applications
**Problem:** test_echo tool not visible  
**Solution:** 
1. Restart the application completely
2. Check application logs for MCP connection errors
3. Verify config files manually

### Test Hangs
**Problem:** Test appears stuck  
**Solution:** Press Ctrl+C to cancel, check application logs

## Manual Verification (Alternative)

If you prefer to test manually without the script:

### 1. Install Test Server
```bash
cd utils/mcp_manager
mcp-manager install local test-echo-server --source test-echo-server
```

### 2. Configure Platforms
```bash
mcp-manager config claude
mcp-manager config cline
```

### 3. Test Removal Commands
```bash
# Remove from one platform
mcp-manager remove from-claude test-echo-server --yes

# Remove from other platform
mcp-manager remove from-cline test-echo-server --yes

# Complete removal
mcp-manager remove server test-echo-server --yes
```

### 4. Verify Each Step
Check config files manually at:
- Claude: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Cline: `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`
- Registry: `~/.config/mcp-manager/servers/servers.json`

## Questions?

If you encounter issues or have questions about the test:
1. Check the `FUNCTIONAL_TEST_PLAN.md` for detailed test phases
2. Review the test script itself for implementation details
3. Check mcp-manager logs: `~/.config/mcp-manager/logs/`

## Summary

This test validates that:
- âœ… Servers can be removed from individual platforms
- âœ… Servers can be removed from registry only
- âœ… Complete removal works in one command
- âœ… Configs are updated correctly
- âœ… Files are cleaned up properly
- âœ… Backups are created automatically
- âœ… No damage to other configured servers
