## Notes & Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- Using "healthcheck" instead of "doctor" for diagnostic command
- No backward compatibility - clean slate implementation
- Typer for CLI framework with Rich for output formatting
- Pydantic for data models and validation

### Current Focus
- **Next Item**: Health checking framework (`core/health.py`)
- **Priority**: Finish Phase 1 foundation before moving to commands

### Issues & Blockers
_None currently identified_
