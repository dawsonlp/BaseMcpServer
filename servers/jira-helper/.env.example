# MCP Server identity (customize this for your server)

# Server settings (rarely need to be changed in Docker environments)
# HOST=0.0.0.0  # Default to all interfaces - generally no need to change this
# PORT=7501     # Default MCP port - no need to change as Docker handles port mapping

# API key for authentication
# This should be a strong, unique value in production
API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Legacy single Jira instance settings (for backward compatibility)
# These will be used as the "primary" instance if JIRA_INSTANCES is not configured

# Multiple Jira instances configuration (JSON format)
# Use this to configure multiple Jira instances. Each instance needs name, url, user, token, and optional description.
# You can format this as a single line or use multi-line format with proper JSON escaping.
#
# Single line example:
# JIRA_INSTANCES=[{"name": "production", "url": "https://company.atlassian.net", "user": "user@company.com", "token": "token1", "description": "Production Jira"}, {"name": "staging", "url": "https://staging.atlassian.net", "user": "user@company.com", "token": "token2", "description": "Staging Jira"}]
#
# Multi-line example (more readable):
# JIRA_INSTANCES='[
#   {
#     "name": "production",
#     "url": "https://company.atlassian.net",
#     "user": "user@company.com",
#     "token": "your-production-token",
#     "description": "Production Jira instance"
#   },
#   {
#     "name": "staging", 
#     "url": "https://staging.atlassian.net",
#     "user": "user@company.com",
#     "token": "your-staging-token",
#     "description": "Staging Jira instance"
#   }
# ]'
#
# Note: When using multi-line format, wrap the entire JSON in single quotes
JIRA_INSTANCES=[]

# Add any additional environment variables your server needs below
# DEBUG_MODE=false
# LOG_LEVEL=INFO
