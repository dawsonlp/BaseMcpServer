  - [ ] Test advanced operations (create issues, search, workflows)
  - [ ] Verify error handling works correctly

### 3. Integration Testing
- [ ] **End-to-end workflow testing**
  - [ ] Test complete issue lifecycle (create ‚Üí update ‚Üí transition ‚Üí close)
  - [ ] Test project management operations
  - [ ] Test search and reporting functions
  - [ ] Test time tracking and work logging

- [ ] **Multi-instance testing**
  - [ ] Configure multiple Jira instances
  - [ ] Test operations across different instances
  - [ ] Verify instance isolation works correctly

### 4. Performance & Reliability Validation
- [ ] **Performance testing**
  - [ ] Test response times for common operations
  - [ ] Verify bulk operations perform acceptably
  - [ ] Test with large result sets
  - [ ] Monitor memory usage during operations

- [ ] **Error handling validation**
  - [ ] Test network connectivity issues
  - [ ] Test authentication failures
  - [ ] Test invalid input handling
  - [ ] Verify graceful degradation

### 5. Documentation Updates
- [ ] **Update README.md**
  - [ ] Document installation process
  - [ ] Update configuration instructions
  - [ ] Add usage examples
  - [ ] Document all available tools

- [ ] **Clean up outdated files**
